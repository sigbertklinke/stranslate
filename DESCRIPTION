Description: Message translation is often managed with po files and the programme "gettext", but sometimes a lightweight solution is needed.
    In contrast to po files, a more flexible approach is used as in Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org/). 
    A key-value approach allows easier handling of translated messages.
